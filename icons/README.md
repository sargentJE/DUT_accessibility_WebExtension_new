# Icons for Accessibility Helper Extension

You need to add the following icon sizes to this directory:

- `icon16.png` (16×16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48×48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128×128 pixels)

These icons should follow MyVision Oxfordshire's branding guidelines and color scheme, featuring:
- Primary blue color: #0072bb
- A symbol representing accessibility (such as a person with arms extended, a universal access symbol, or a simplified eye icon)

## Suggested Design
For an accessibility-focused extension, consider using:
- A clean, simple design with high contrast
- The universal accessibility icon or a stylized eye symbol
- The primary blue (#0072bb) as the background color with white icon elements

## Icon Usage
These icons will be used in:
- Chrome extension toolbar (16px)
- Extensions management page (48px)
- Chrome Web Store and installation dialog (128px)

## Creating Icons
You can create these icons using design tools like:
- Adobe Illustrator
- Figma
- Sketch
- GIMP
- Inkscape

For best results, design the icon at the largest size (128px) first, then scale down for the smaller sizes, adjusting details as needed for clarity at small sizes.

## Requirements
- All icons should be in PNG format
- Icons should have transparency where appropriate
- Icons should be designed on a square canvas
- The visual elements should be centered within the canvas
